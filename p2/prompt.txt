See the assignment in assignment.md. I have already done part 1 of the assignment and want to do the part 2 of the assignment. The code of part 1 is in p1_client and p2_server. Because this is an competitive assignment, i want to do the most efficient implementation as possible. This is a well researched topic, you are free to research the web and look for the most efficient congestion control algorithm. Think carefully and tell me what will you implement, then implement that. part2.txt has the benchmark values.
